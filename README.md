# Switcheroo - A simple colorscheme switcher
This plugin allows to switch your colorscheme and make a quick preview with a code snippet.
What differentiates this plugin from other is that it sources every month the colorschemes on [Awesome-neovim](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim) 
## Note that this is in early stages and it can break.

## Install

<details>
<summary><b>ðŸ’¤ Lazy.nvim ðŸ’¤</b></summary>

``` lua
{
    "MrSloth-dev/Switcheroo.nvim",
    dependencies = { "rktjmp/lush.nvim", "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim" },
    opts = {}
},
```
</details>

## Dependecies

- [Lush](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim) as some colorschemes have that dependency.
- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
- [Neovim >= 0.10](https://neovim.io/)

## Usage

Ever wanted to try new colorschemes but the search, clone, install and update cycle is too boring?

Now you can open the Preview Window with `:Switcheroo` and see the list of the colorschemes avaiable for you and hot reload the colorscheme with a code snippet preview. Then you can select by pressing `<Enter>`

By default the plugin is showing only with the already installed in your computer.
